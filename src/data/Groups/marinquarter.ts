//   There are 7 houses, a communal area with a kitchen, a communal workshop for wood, bike repairs and metalworks and a Van, that everyone can use.
//   The decisionmaking is done by the board, which consists of one person from each house plus three executive members. so the platform is being used to let tenants participate and deliberate about decisions, and organize events, make reservations for the van or the workshop.
//
//
//   Subgroups:
// House 1: Students, in total 7. mostly young men studying mechanics or engineering, mathematics, physics etc. They like to have parties from time to time and dont have a lot of money. They love to use the workshop, but not so much the communal kitchen. They also have small businesses for goods that they produce in the workshop.
//   House 2: Also students, mixed with languages, philosophy, law, social science. 12 tenants in total. They keep it calm an like social gatherings
// House 11: two families share this house: 4 adults, 5 children and one elder person
