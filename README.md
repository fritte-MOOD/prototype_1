MOOD is a prototype for an all-in-one MassOpenOnlineDeliberation platform with focus on flexibility and customizability. It was developed for a bachelors thesis of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin by Fritz Schmack in 2025.

The deployment can be examined following this link: https://prototype-1-opal.vercel.app/

The theoretical work, my final thesis can be found here: https://github.com/fritte-MOOD/prototype_1/blob/main/Background_thesis_Abschlussarbeit.pdf

# INFORMATION


Start reading the thesis:

In times of increasing globalization, global connectivity is higher than ever before. In 2024,
68 percent of the world’s population used the internet, compared to 37 percent in 2014 [1].
This comes with the potential of valuable communication and collaboration, dialogue and
exchange. At the same time, societies all over the world are growing apart [2]–[4]. The
population of Germany, currently ranked 13th in the democracy index, is having major
issues finding consensus as disinformation like fake news and populism are on the rise [2],
[5]. The internet, once considered a technology that can potentially unite people, is now
driving us apart, as all of today’s most important social platforms are profit-driven [2],
[6]–[10]. One major consequence is the digital isolation from opposing views through
digital filtering, described by two phenomena called “echo chambers“ and “filter bubble“
[11]–[14].
At the same time, when users interact outside of their chambers or bubbles with users
of different beliefs and opinions, these interactions tend to be counterproductive and
volatile [15]–[18]. The author assumes that the observed behavior is not the result of an
anthropological constant (“that’s just how people are”), but is instead largely shaped by
the design and functional logic of these digital platforms. Studies suggest, that the design
of social platforms has a direct influence on the behavior of users: The concept “code is
law” by Lessig asserts that on the internet, the primary source of social norms is encoded
within the platforms [19]. Gastil and Davis [7] offer multiple reasons, why the current
design of mainstream social platforms is harmful: ”Further, Facebook has shared millions
of users’ personal information with political manipulators, who used the data to target
users with disinformation (“fake news”) to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election
[8], [20]. Commercial Internet companies have been the objects of various other critiques,
such as the charge that they promote racism through crude algorithms [21], [22], cause
widespread depression and social anxiety among young people [23], undermine social
intimacy [24], alter brain chemistry and processes in unhealthy ways [25], and decimate
the kind of journalism that is essential to a well-functioning democracy [26]–[28].“

“Deliberation is the careful discussion before decision, and it can be defined as
the thorough dialogical assessment of the reasons for and against a measure
before a decision is made.”
— Anastasiou et al. [29]

Deliberation has been found to improve accuracy and contentment of a groups de-
cision [30], [31]. And many tools are supporting groups in their day-to-day decision
making, all with their own idea of deliberation implemented into code. But for each
function such as voting, discussion or ideation, a separate tool is needed and there is
no link between them. For the sake of comparability, assessability and testability for
researchers, standardization, scalability and consistency for programmers and clarity,
accessibility and efficiency for users the author believes, that a common framework is
necessary. The desired platform functions as an intelligent hub, that a group can precisely
tailor to their specific needs. All conceivable features should be offered for selection and
1
are linked together logically. How a decision is made, is entirely up to the users. Maybe
the platform is used for discussion and the decision is made by elected board members
in an offline meeting, by the owner of a company or by a parliament as usual. However,
groups can even find new ways to consensus through online deliberation. As a result of
this interconnection of different features, monitoring features allow any user to create
statistics about a groups behavior and draw comprehensive conclusions about questions
like ”Does our board favor a certain portion of the group?“ “Are decisions generally made
against a certain fundamental principle that a group expects?“. And finally, if such a
platform can exist, transparency could drastically improve, decision makers would know
what their group expects from them and a group knows whether their leaders act in their
interest or not.
Towards an open standard for mass online deliberation, this work will first explore the
different ways, deliberation happens in today’s online spaces. Relevant tools are analyzed
and features are defined, that will need to be included. Secondly, a literature review is
conducted to understand the current state of research. It highlights the relevant design
aspects and provides the basis for the next step: In the chapter ”Design Implications”,
necessary next steps towards mass online deliberation are discussed and a larger framework
is conceptualized as a solid foundation to build future research upon. Resulting from
these considerations, a prototype is developed, functioning as a demo version of new
form of for social network. Basic functions are displayed as users can explore imaginary
examples of online communities. And finally, limitations and possible future work are
discussed, concluding with a summary of the key findings and their implications.
